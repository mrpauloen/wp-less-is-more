== Important note: Default WordPress Gallery ==

If you want to wraps the content of a WordPress media gallery in a Twitter's Bootstrap grid, we recommend to use this plugin:

https://github.com/bassjobsen/twitterbootstrap-galleries
https://wordpress.org/plugins/twitter-bootstrap-galleries/

otherwise your thumbnails will get one below the others.


== Theme Notes ==

The primary purpose of this theme was to resolve the dispute with Google.

Leads a campaign required the optimization of the website.

Unfortunately, the existing themes which had the nature of blogging, did not meet such criteria.
It was necessary, therefore, to create a clear, transparent and simple theme. On the front page as well as on the back end.

First of all adapted for mobile devices. Without unnecessary elements the typical for blogs (e.g. graphics).
Its components had to be "responsive" (multiplatform).


To meet existing demand of the business market,
we reached after the popular and already available libraries from bootstrap.

But an additional problem appeared.
Bootstrap was not, and yet is not at all compatible with WordPress.

After many months of struggle with the code and adapting it to the WordPress platform,
we have reached the critical point where the final product is a theme called:
WP Less is More, mobile and bootstrap ready theme.

That because this is his first edition, it is still in the testing phase.

This means that users who use it, test its features and up to date report errors,
the word "criticism" or gaps in functionality.

Such cooperation, bilateral relationship and exchange of experience helps
create the foundations of a suitable environment to create a product ideally suited for the customer.



== Other Theme Features ==

Stuff like:

* Widgets Areas
* Post Thumbnail
* Custom Header and Background

are only extra additions and may not working as you may expected.

We mostly focused on content because CONTEN IS THE KING!

Any of these inconvenience functions will be considered on the support forum.
We didn't want to build this theme for blogers users but for business people
who need stuff like:

* Saless Latters
* Squeeze Pagess
* Landing Pages

only.


== Custom footer ==


Now you can turn off/on or change default footer text simple on Customizer screen
Allowed HTML tags: <a href="" title=""> <b> <del datetime=""> <em> <i> <q cite=""> <s> <strike> <strong>.

Footer text is "on" by default.


== Custom excerpt lenght ==

By default the excerpt length is set to return 55 words.
Now you can change it in Customizer by moving the slider.
Avaible range is from 1 to 100 but you can set whetever you want
in the input field below.
This functiolality works only for posts with empty excerpt metabox
(even if you used <!-- more --> tag) and only with the_excerpt function,
so it doesn't work for teaser when the_content() function is used.
